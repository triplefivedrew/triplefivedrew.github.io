I finally got round to importing my <a href="http://triplefivedrew.blogspot.com">blogspot</a> account (blocked in China). I spent 5 years on the hunt for 'fine English cuisine' and will be doing the same in Shanghai. It may take some deep delving to match the brass tacks heartiness of <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/taste/?p=43">Great Queen Street</a>, visual onslaught of <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/taste/?p=9">Les Trois Garcons</a> or the decadence of the <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/taste/?p=40" target="_self">Cap d'Antibes</a> but if it exists - I'll find it.

If you're ever on the queen's soil - take a look at <a href="http://triplefivedrew.com/taste" target="_blank">these</a> suggestions.
