This modern Chinese restaurant is a welcome addition to the blossoming Réel Mall, offering a strong array of regional Hunanese signature dishes.

As one of China’s most treasured cuisines, Hunan food is a definite crowd-pleaser among both locals and Westerners. With enough variety to cover hunks of meat, grilled seafood, cauldrons of spice and fresh flash-fried veggies, it’s no wonder that this large, mall-archetype restaurant is already as popular as some of Shanghai’s existing Hunan eateries.

Which is where the necessary comparisons come in. Going head to head with the powerhouses of Di Shui Dong and Gu Yi is quite a challenge. Ten Ten Bistro is at first impression a similarly comprehensive Hunanese offering. It is slightly more upscale than Gu Yi and less rustic than Di Shui Dong, yet significantly less hectic than both.

Prices at Ten Ten are slightly higher, though not by much. A plate of their signature gargantuan pork ribs (RMB130) feels reasonable. They’re meaty, grilled to perfection and covered in cumin and chili seeds. Similarly classic is a basket of a dozen or so skewered prawns (RMB98). Large, juicy and invigoratingly spiced, they are arguably one of China’s best seafood dishes.

With the main attractions covered, the rest of Ten Ten’s menu is left to a fair share of stir fried and crock pot dishes. A bowl of Dong An chicken (RMB68) features tender chunks of meat in a curiously sour yet fresh salad of shredded cabbage and peppers. Also fresh is a flash-fry plate of crisp cabbage and Chinese bacon (RMB48) mixed with oil and piquant chili.

And we’ve just scratched the surface. Ten Ten Hunan Bistro has the size and the goods to wade into Shanghai and take top spot. Let the battle begin.
