If you’re slightly intoxicated on Yongkang Lu and yearning for a quick bite, then Oh My Kebab is the answer. This little spot next to Café de Staigieres takes a lively and slightly scrappy approach to drinks and nosh that seems fitting for the bustling street.

In the same space that used to be Handle Bar, the owners have switched their focus to another growing trend in Shanghai: offering a simple menu of kebabs, wraps and pitas made with fresh meat and vegetables. On our recent visits, the restaurant had chicken one time and pork another, both of which had succulence and flavor that put them a notch or two above the usual inner-city offerings.

However, Shanghai has a burgeoning scene of non-greasy, clean tasting kebabs with the likes of Brothers Kebab and Lina’s. Even Anadolu has been upping its game. In comparison, Oh My Kebab’s flatbread wraps (RMB40 for chicken and pork / RMB45 for beef and lamb) are a little stiff and their fillings unbalanced. One mouthful is all salad, the next all meat.

But when a jumbo plate (a large unwrapped version, RMB50) comes with a free glass of Stella, there's really no reason to venture outside of Yongkang Lu for a filling meal. Sided with a plate of cheese fries (RMB25), it’s a fitting ticket to soak up the joys of a crawl along Shanghai’s hottest bar street and keep the party going.
