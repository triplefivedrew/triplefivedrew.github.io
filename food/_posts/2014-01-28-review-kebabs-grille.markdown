Jinqiao has almost every global cuisine represented in six blocks of expat zone. Kebabs on the Grille’s third location in Shanghai is the Indian representative in the Biyun Green Sports and Leisure Center.
As it's located in a family-oriented community, things are slow at night and it took a while for our Kingfishers (RMB45) to arrive. Perhaps if we were here for Sunday brunch, they would've been here much faster.

The food is the familiar Western-friendly take on one of the world’s most celebrated cuisines. Signature dishes are meat-focused and grand in flavor. Kebabs on the Grille knows just how to tame the flames to please the masses. A plate of mahi fish medallions (RMB150) is a mouthful of succulence in a tangy glaze. Wrapped in strips of mince stuffed naan (RMB45), it’s an expensive but rewarding duo.

Elsewhere on the curry list, a green lentil dahl (RMB50) packed a spicy kick but needed another dimension to bring its lentils to full potential. Also lacking is the saag chicken (RMB70), where the spinach and chicken needed to be stewed longer for more depth in flavor. The slow-roast mutton and crushed wheat haleem (RMB80) provided a succulent end to our meal.

To keep customers happy in a city of expanding wallets and dining choices, Kebabs on the Grille may need to deliver better to fend off increasingly fierce competition.
