They say that in business it’s crucial to know your customer. Element Fresh knows us very well. They know we like well-prepared, fresh, simple produce and that we’re willing to pay for it in healthy portions.

They also know that we don’t just do brunches and lunches. We like to let our hair down in the evenings too. Element Fresh Vintage is their Xintiandi nightlife spot. The concept is a no-brainer. They offer everything an Element Fresh has, but with the lights turned down and the music up. Outside on the terrace is a prime location for people watching on Xintiaindi’s popular thoroughfare. Inside are three floors of sultrily-lit tables including an airy rooftop terrace.

To benchmark, we tried the classic firecracker salmon (RMB148), two pieces of boneless pink fish grilled in house in nine spices and served with snow peas and an almost Thai-sticky rice. It’s effortlessly balanced and delicious.

Vintage-specific additions to the menu include a tad expensive but utterly mouthwatering spicy prawn salad with miso dressing and glazed pecans (RMB188), and they also have a bar menu offering snacks until 2am including praise-worthy tiger prawn and mango ceviche (RMB78) and a light and fresh quesadilla (RMB68). This is all on top of an extensive drink list. They’ve also greatly expanded their wine offerings, and will walk you through a three-course food / wine pairing for RMB450.

Yes, it’s more of the same. Yes, it’s in tourist central. But it still works and we’ll come again, though you'll probably want to avoid it for family outings.
