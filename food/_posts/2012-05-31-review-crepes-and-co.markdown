Nestled in a corner of Shanghai Centre, Crêpes & Co is a relaxed and friendly café serving up great dessert pancakes and some passable savoury ones too. Their 40-strong savoury menu (ranging from RMB45 to RMB93) offers variations of what is a perfectly thin crêpe wrapped around almost any combination of ingredients imaginable, from a cheese and egg Fermiere to a “London”-themed version with bacon, spinach and cottage cheese.

Unfortunately, the crêpes are let down by what should be fresh and simple produce encased within. The smoked salmon in a wine and cream sauce (RMB78) was a little too blanched in a tepid sauce. Better was an egg, bacon, ham, mushrooms & cheese supreme (RMB86), but at this price it’s on the small side, contains only average produce and needs an accompaniment like the loaded bacon Caesar salad (RMB49).

The dessert pancakes, on the other hand, are where Crêpes & Co shines. Again they’ve everything from the standard orange butter and liquor Suzette (RMB62) to Calvados flambée (RMB85) with sautéed apples and rum & raisin ice cream. We loved the fresh mango and coconut ice-cream which, mixing around inside a wonderfully sweet crêpe (RMB58), offers a series of truly delicious mouthfuls.
