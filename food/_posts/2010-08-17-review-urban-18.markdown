Urban 18 is an inner-city homage to the sport of finesse; golf. It’s a putters dream with golf simulators off to one side and a golf house lounge on the other. 

The menu has pints of Kilkenny and Guinness on draft (RMB65) and a short, Laris-designed menu with sliders, salads and a handful of refined pub classics. The tapas starter (RMB60) has six bite-sized, meticulously prepared eats–satay, tortilla and a goat cheese tart. It’s a cacophony of flavors. Similarly well presented was their fantastic fish and chips (RMB90), a succulent, meaty fillet of snapper surrounded by light golden batter, potato wedges and homemade tartar sauce. The loaded club sandwich (RMB55) drew similar applause. This is as close as you’ll get to a real clubhouse experience in town.
