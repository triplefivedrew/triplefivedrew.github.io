Xuhui | el Efante<br />

This coconut ceviche (RMB95) at el Efante uses a five-minute citrus marinating process and three types of chillies to seal cubes of kingfish with a spicy, tangy exterior. Topped with diced sweet potato and caramelized maple syrup, a lime sorbet and some toasted coconut is layered on to complete the dish. It’s a tumultuous bowl of incredible flavor which highlights the freshness of the fish. Slurp down the milky leche de tigre juices in the bowl for a beautiful ending to the dish.

Jing'an | El Bodegon<br />
Marinating cubes of raw fish in citrus juices is a national tradition of Peru and El Bodegon’s Peruvian chef has it down to a fine art. The ceviche El Bodegon (RMB70) pairs clean, citrus-seared sea bass with tender rings of fried calamari. They swim together in the piquant juices, which are colored red from the imported rocoto limes. Fiery and refreshing, chunks of sweet corn and potato can be munched at the end to reduce the heat.

Lujiazui | Nadaman<br />

Japanese gastronomy is no stranger to raw seafood. Nadaman’s prawn ceviche (RMB85) pays homage to Peruvian culture and preparation methods. Deluxe ebi prawns are marinated in a light lemon miso vinaigrette, resulting in a tender mouthful of freshness, fortified by a base of fierce wasabi. Served with purple Romaesco broccoli and togarashi chili pepper, this ceviche is a cacophony of exotic textures and flavors.
