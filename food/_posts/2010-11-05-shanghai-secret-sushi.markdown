Rolling around the streets in the corner between Changshu and Huaihai  we chanced upon an awesome sushi shack. Through a tiny window is a cute table, at which a Japanese chef is rolling one of a handful varieties of maki with absolute precision. It’s picturesque beyond belief, tasty as it gets and comes with with some excellent fresh wasabi.

This is Exactly the reason why Shanghai rocks, because it's bristling with secrets. We probably roll pass a dozen a day and don’t even know it, a missed glance and it’s all over. As we sat on the kerb popping a salmon roll and eel ebi, passers buy stopped to gawk. Soon there was a queue.

Location is on Huating Lu at the junction with Yanqing Lu <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=wanping+road&sll=31.230393,121.473704&sspn=0.850189,1.766052&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=China+Shanghai+Wan+Ping+Lu&ll=31.214774,121.450295&spn=0.003322,0.006899&z=17">here</a>.
