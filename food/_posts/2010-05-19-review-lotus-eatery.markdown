If you’re after good, fresh Yunnanese food, check this place out. The small, bustling restaurant is decorated somewhat like a primary school project, but they are serious about representing the area with a menu that features Dai dishes and a page devoted to wild mushrooms.

We started with a Dai black chicken salad (¥32), packed with tiny fresh peppers that almost blew our spice-loving heads off. After we washed it down with a couple of big bottles of Dali beer (¥16), we forged on with a tasty, deep-fried Miao barbecued fish (¥48), flavor-packed stewed aubergine (¥16), day-fresh beef liver mushrooms stir-fried with green peppers (¥60) and finished with a not-to-be-missed plate of “Grandma’s” homestyle chunky mashed potatoes (¥16).
