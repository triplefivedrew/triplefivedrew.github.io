For all their good intentions and comfortable atmosphere, Crazy Oyster House is a little too elementary to be a true contender.
	
The petite restaurant has been open for a while under a different guise as Crazy Noodle Bar. Recently it reopened to offer seafood and modern European cuisine. They’ve kept the same tidy and simple decor, and added a chalkboard listing their daily selections of oysters and fresh seafood. The printed menu lists rarities like Boston lobster (RMB280/500g) and Devon crabs (RMB165/500g).

On our visit, oyster options included only a handful of French types, such as Golden Ostre (RMB38/RMB217/RMB420 for one/half-dozen/dozen) and Gillardeau (RMB48/RMB276/RMB540). At this price they’re competitive with the likes of The Plump Oyster, but Crazy Oyster House lacks the deluxe experience of live-shucking at a plush low-lit bar.

The oysters themselves are fine enough. Half a dozen Tsarskaya (RMB258) slid down like velvet with a clean ocean bite. It does allow a complete enough flavor, though sometimes a jumbo oyster can feel infinitely more exciting.

Elsewhere, the menu is disappointing and lacks finish. A couple skewers of satay beef (RMB18) are simple and missing kick. A trio of scallops with house special sauce (RMB58) combines limp, cold scallops with a warmed dressing and is all over far too quickly. The main of poached salmon with herb béarnaise (RMB108) tastes ordinary and could be matched in many kitchens across the city.

Crazy Oyster House is a brave curiosity. With an upgrade to their complete offering, this could be a great neighborhood venue for fresh seafood and oysters. For now it’s a little disconnected.
