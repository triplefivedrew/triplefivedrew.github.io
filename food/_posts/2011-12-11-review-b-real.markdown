Not content with authentic soup noodles, the owners of Pho Real have set up a stall across the road serving up Vietnam’s other national treasure–the bánh mì sandwich.

A true Franco-Viet mashup, they traditionally feature slices of pork cutlet, pickled veg, cucumber and coriander wrapped in a crusty baguette and left just long enough for the flavours to seep into the fluffy bread. B Real’s pork and chicken meal combos (RMB45-55) are, like the café itself, fresh, light and innocently fun.

But forget the bland prawn crackers (RMB10) and oily fish cakes (RMB25). Instead, order a side of moreish sweet potato nuggets (RMB25) and smile for the Polaroid if you’re looking to get immortalized on their photo wall.
