Located on the corner of the blossoming 800 Show complex, this sultry, Dianping-recommended spot is at least a cool place to watch the world go by. But maybe that’s what the kitchen is doing too.

Our Caesar salad (RMB50) came drenched in dressing and both the carbonara (RMB48) and shrimp spaghetti (RMB52) were overwhelmingly heavy on the sauces. We weren’t complaining at the richness of a chocolate moon brownie (RMB30) but a thin slice of their cheesecake (RMB30) had an unwelcome citron tang.

The buffalo wings (RMB28), while far from buffalo (no sauce), were succulent enough, and the devilled eggs (RMB25) are a surprising treat. It’s best to come here for a cocktail and a couple appetizers.
