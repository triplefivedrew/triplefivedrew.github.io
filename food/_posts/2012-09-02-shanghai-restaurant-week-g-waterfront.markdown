As part of this year's Shanghai restaurant week I was graciously invited to a dress-rehearsal of G Waterfront's offering as their fixe-prix menu. <a href="http://www.restaurantweek.cn/lang/en/cities/shanghai/restaurants" target="_blank">RW 2012</a> will see over 100 restaurants across town offering 3 courses every evening between sept 2nd-9th... all for either RMB 168 or 248.

The unique factor with <a href="http://www.cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/listings/dining/indian/has/g-waterfront/" target="_blank">G Waterfront</a> is that it's dedicated to a cuisine we don't often associate with the echelon: Indian. People will be flocking to find seats in the likes of Jean Georges and Sabatini but with a typical bill at G pushing 1,500 for two, their proposal is a toe dipping without heavy investment.

Not that your toes are in any danger. Imported Indian flour, spices and chefs ensure an adherence to a comprehensive and traditional menu. The dishes have all been selected to represent the breadth of a cuisine that has a story as varied and rich as China.

The restaurant week menu starts with a selection of appetizers including tandoori prawns and creamy Papri Chat. Then it's a story of curry with four carefully placed classics amid pilaf rice. Expect insanely smooth butter chicken and complex lamb Rogan Josh with an option or two from their half-dozen or so signature nans.

As a previously Brick Lane (London) dweller and long time Indian food aficionado, it's a tremendous affair and amongst the best I've eaten. In Shanghai. On the Bund. Who'd have thought? I guess it's obvious when you think about it.

Such is the beauty of restaurant week. It's a chance to explore what's out there and discover that the answer is more than you'd think. Of course it's also a chance to get a cheaper meal at a luxurious venue. Either way do it. They've already had 20,000 reservations for lunches and dinners across the city. There's plenty of places left they tell me with a nudge and a wink. Find out what's available <a href="http://www.restaurantweek.cn/lang/en/cities/shanghai/restaurants">here</a>.
