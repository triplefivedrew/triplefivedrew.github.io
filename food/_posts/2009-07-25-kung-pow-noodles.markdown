We've eaten a fair few bowls of noodles (Mian) since arriving. There are roadside huts pulling out noodles while you wait on every other street. Last night, however, pushed a single bowl of string from quick-fix to long-remembered. Along <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=106044707941414690987.00046f85f7ebcf6528a40&amp;ll=31.202854,121.438558&amp;spn=0.006571,0.013797&amp;z=16">Tianping Lu</a> at #220 sits a small eight-table noodle shop that looks like a third world greasy spoon diner. The are no pictures and the menu is chinese only but they know what we're here for - Kung Pow JiMian. Two bowls of fresh, tongue-tingling chicken noodles arrive barely a minute later. 12RMB (£1.10).
