It’s not often you walk into a restaurant and are greeted by a picture of a ten-foot belly dancer. At least you know you’re in the right place as you set eyes on the huge screen that virtually covers one wall of this impressive middle-eastern Halal restaurant.

They’ve steered clear of the typical Persian-carpeted, cushion-filled dens that are all too often symbolic of this genre and have put some thought into the menu too, with everything from hummus to haleem (a traditional wheat porridge) covered.

The freshly-made hummus is served straight or, for a more hearty treat, rolled with a light tomato salad into a warm shawarma (¥45). We explored the region with a plate of tabbouleh (¥45), a generous and freshly flavored parsley and mint chopped salad (served with their unique caramel-dusted pita) and an expensive but perfectly herb-blended lamb kofta kebab (¥75). The tour ended with a rich and spicy chicken masala (¥55) that sent us right back to that gap year in India.

Ask for it fiery if you dare; soothe the flames with a light mango lassi (¥28). After one or two more flaky-pastry topped baklava (¥30), it seemed only right to settle down with one of the 28 flavors of imported shisha (¥75) that they offer and get back to the giant belly dancer.
