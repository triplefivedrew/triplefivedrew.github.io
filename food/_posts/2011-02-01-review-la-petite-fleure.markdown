Shanghai’s dating scene is in for a treat. La Petit Fleur has just set a new benchmark for fantastic food, intimate surroundings and attentive service… and you don’t have to pay through the nose for it.

The short menu is loosely pan-European with a French focus. To start, a roast beef and white bean salad (¥45) was tremendously succulent and full flavored exactly where it mattered. The waiter had already prepared a second round of crusty baguette to mop up the olive oil dressing. A rich and creamy pumpkin risotto (¥55) stood apart from others thanks to a good stock and liberally applied feta.

The Star anise duck (¥138) will blow your mind. Slices of juicy, tender meat with orange and a creamy garlic mash put to shame the usual street-side roast duck offering. Things will never be the same again.

Wrapping up nicely with a delicious blueberry panacotta (¥35); if the charming surroundings, the bell on the wall around the corner with a sign saying “ring me for attention” or the fantastic service somehow aren’t enough – Shanghai’s best duck dish is plenty reason to come back here again and again.
