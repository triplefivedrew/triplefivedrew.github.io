Jiu Jiu is a Japanese restaurant buried under a Mount Fuji of mid-upper range all-you-can-eats in Shanghai so large that it will take a couple more stars than snow crab and foie gras to help it rise above.

A RMB298 ticket provides unlimited supplies of sashimi, sushi, tempura, grilled meats, hot pot and virtually everything the A-to-Z of Japanese cuisine has to offer. Free-flow drinks are included as expected.

As the sushi counter at the doorway would have you believe, raw seafood cuts are suitably fresh with tasty and varied sashimi. Their Chinese snow crab legs are pleasingly meaty, though much smaller than their Japanese counterparts. You’ll need to order the otherwise boring seafood hot pot to get a taste of them.

As wave after wave of everything we pointed at arrived, standouts included prawn tempura in a correctly light batter, succulent lamb chops and some extremely smooth foie gras. This is certainly a dozen notches down from Kappo Yu, but everything holds together well.

Shanghai is no stranger to unlimited supplies of seafood that eventually taper off. Jiu Jiu doesn’t seem in too big a rush to lower the quality of their cuts but they did forget a few dishes. Similarly, either our eyes or our bellies had grown smaller when it came time for late game re-orders.

As last orders eventually rolled in, we were left with a feeling of stuffed satisfaction. If this was our first time at such a Shanghai institution it would be far more impressive. However, with the likes of Kagen, Itsuki and Hatsuhana in the mix, Jiu Jiu looks set to be a place to call when those top options are fully booked.
