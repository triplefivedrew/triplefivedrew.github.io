There’s nothing more satisfying than sitting in a slice of somewhere or sometime else. The Boulevard, with its penthouse flair and speakeasy appeal, is one such escape from the humdrum of daily life to a time full of proper debauchery and corruption. The Prohibition Era spot serves a mean cocktail, but to be honest, the drinks play second fiddle to a couple of stars on the food menu. The highest roller on the inspired list is their Lobster Mac and Cheese (RMB88).

It is a little Le Creuset pot filled with a rich, creamy serving of soft macaroni drenched in American cheese, with chunks of lobster tail thrown in for good measure. Each mouthful is a teleportation to a time when adding spice meant a dash of Chartreuse and dancing the tango. Here is a dish which is about celebrating the American home-food staple of some pasta and some cheddar mixed in a bowl. Everybody had it. Not everybody put lobster tail in theirs though. Kick back at the bar with an Old Fashioned and on a clear night, those high-rises twinkling outside the windows could be downtown Manhattan.
