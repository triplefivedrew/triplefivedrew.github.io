VUE is the total package. It has Shanghai’s best view, an eloquent dining concept and world-class, wonderfully prepared food. To be honest though, when the first two are put into perspective, VUE could be offering beans on toast. These are the upper floors of the Hyatt on the Bund, perched up around the corner of the Huangpu allowing 180 blissful degrees Pudong and Puxi. Inside is no less inspiring. VUE’s dining room spans a luxury apartment’s decor, from dark-wood library to stainless modern kitchen. Tables are scattered throughout, portraying an air of casual but comfortable sophistication.

This, of course, isn’t beans on toast. It is a simple but no-expense-spared menu, covering a dozen plates spanning a glamorously continental list of meat, fish and vegetables. Seasonally they present a ¥480 four-course set menu. Otherwise, expect to pay ¥1,000-plus before drinks.

For this price you’re presented with high eminence, pristinely presented food. Each dish is brought in as its elements and prepared at one of the spotless kitchens alongside diners. The experience feels like private dining as our chef intently concocts an explosively flavored Boston lobster bisque (¥160) and al-dente Champagne, Parmesan and truffle risotto (¥165).

Mains maintain the euphoria. A succulent fillet of Macadamia-crusted cod in an orange butter and fennel chips (¥280) is all but perfect, complementing clean fish with a refreshing sauce. Steaks are priced to the heavens and approaching there in flavor. A 300g prime rib (¥340), served with a curious puff of bread, is all about the meat, and with a side of rösti (¥50) and béarnaise sauce becomes a perhaps not-rewarding but certainly sumptuous affair.

It’s expensive, but VUE offers top-notch cuisine in a superlative setting.
