After starting with a generous, punchy glass of sangria (RMB30) at a cozy candlelit table, we were ready to be impressed by Taska, the Spanish chain that first broke into China with a shop in the Madrid Pavilion. It’s too bad the tapas here fell short.

Taska’s Chinese take on “chorizo” (RMB38) featured none of its Spanish counterpart’s rich and meaty oomph. The Bravas patatas (RMB38) were more like potato wedges drizzled with mayonnaise and a tangy sauce. Slightly better were the crispy croquets (RMB38) with their creamy chicken and onion filling and the Russian potato salad (RMB35) topped with tuna. A pleasantly large 250g rib-eye steak (RMB188) was also well prepared and served with a selection of super-sauces. However, they couldn’t make up for what should have been a night of fine tapas.
