For damn fine Tex-Mex food in a themed but relaxed environment with great service, Mexico Lindo brings the goods. Situated down the Hongmei Pedestrian Street, they’re serving up a huge menu to the strolling masses, piñata-bashing families and regulars who know their daily specials by heart.

On the night we were there it was RMB88 for all-you-can-eat tacos. They’re served the right way: corn and soft-shell (hard-shell is available too) in half a dozen flavors. Take your pick, though the al pastor and carnitas are the obvious winners with their succulent fillings.

Elsewhere on the gargantuan menu there is enough choice to keep both traditionalists and tourists happy. A loaded shrimp cocktail (RMB55) and mixed green mango salad (RMB30) are both zesty and cleanly refreshing.

Mains come from the same stable of fresh ingredients lit up by piquant Tex-Mex flavors. The fajitas with spicy chicken (RMB118) are a love affair of fresh tortilla, stewed meat and refried beans. A pleasingly large piece of grilled salmon served with orange glazed sweet potatoes and a bell pepper sauce (RMB148) sounds over-concocted but comes together well. The owner’s goal of keeping a rolling menu on which only the best dishes remain is clearly working.

We barely had room for a plate of banana chimichangas with vanilla ice cream (RMB40) but found space in the reserve tank. Alongside 40 flavors of frozen margaritas (RMB50), bottles of Corona (RMB40) and some live music, Mexico Lindo is a step outside of Shanghai into a world of color and flavor and one of our picks for an innocently good time on Hongmei Lu.
