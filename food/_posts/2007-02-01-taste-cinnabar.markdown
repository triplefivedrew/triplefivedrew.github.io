Chinnabar, not to be confused with the China Grill (my mistake) is another place I remember from my previous visit to Mexico DF.
On the corner of a busy road I remember watching car's headlights streaking by through floor to ceiling opaque red walls. However, following a recent renovation, the windows are now clear glass and so the impressive ambiance is marginalized by a fishbowl effect.
Its a trendy place, however, with resident DJ and filled up as the evening progressed with two large bars serving (as expected) a plethora of margaritas/cocktails.
Food is asian/mexican fusion which sounds exciting on the menu but lacked when push came  shove. We were convinced by a fun waitress to go for soy and ginger steak and the result was a chewy cut of beef with all the flavor drowned out by a salty soy based sauce.
If the walls are back to red its a great place for a good cocktail, otherwise there are better places around the corner.<span style="font-size:78%;"><br /><span style="color:rgb(153,153,153);font-size:85%;"><br /></span></span><span style="color:rgb(153,153,153);font-family:times new roman;font-size:85%;">Cinnabar<br />67 Nuevo Leon Condesa<br />Mexico City,<br />Telephone: + 55 5286 8456</span>
