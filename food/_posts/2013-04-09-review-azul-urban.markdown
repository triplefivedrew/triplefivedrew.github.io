It looks like the new K11 mall is where the cool kids and young professionals hang out for browsing and nibbles. Azul Urban, up on the fourth floor, is in a strong position to snap up passers-by with light bites and a good drinks menu.

Open plan, Azul’s dining area is more lounge than restaurant. Well-spoken wait staff circle around casually topping up waters and remembering orders without jotting anything down.

It’s with this air of confidence that we almost wildly pointed at items on the menu. It’s similar to Vargas’s other Azul location, European-with-a-LatAm-twist. There’s a sprinkling of tapas, a few sandwiches and a selection of mains all at mostly reasonable prices ... for a swanky mall.

A seared tuna and potato salad (RMB75) is crusted in a fiercely peppery sauce though balanced by a citrus dressing over crisp, fresh leaves. Spicy too was a plate of pork ribs (RMB55). Soaked in an almost dominating infusion of chilli sauce, it packed a stealthy punch. If you’re looking for something hot, you’ve struck gold.

On a more even keel for the casual atmosphere was a superbly juicy and feature-packed avocado and BLT burger (RMB85). Centered around Wagyu, the king of patties, it was everything we hoped for, though they’re still playing with its sizing. Similarly pleasant and flavoursome was a Sicilian chicken sandwich (RMB45). It’s served on ciabatta, which comprehensively soaks up the piquant dressing.

It’s a clear contender for the business-lunch crowd, and perhaps good if other Western options have become a little bland. The real reason to return here though? Their perfectly blended pisco sour (RMB50). It’s a frothy, tart and downright delicious cocktail celebrating 100 years of Peruvian prestige.
