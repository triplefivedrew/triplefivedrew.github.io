Running a new business is like having a second family. Sometimes it's like having a first family. You've built, raised, taught and nurtured something using every skill you have. You've even thought about the day when it will need to fly on it's own, maybe even handed over to someone else.

Which is why employing that first wave of new people is such a delicate process. 

It's not just a case of finding people who are better than you but trying to recognise qualities in a candidate that have grown so organically in ourselves... and may take even longer to develop in someone else.

Or not. Despite a feeling of such careful vetting of a bunch of candidates who ticked most of the boxes, the truth is that most people are just not the right fit. Working in a loose, many-opportunities environment alongside people who implicitly know every aspect of the business... actually means operating without remit in a high pressure office where nobody fully expresses what is going on.

Which is not for everybody. When it isn't for a new employee then the results are perhaps not so obvious. Sure, there are many frameworks for good HR practices and measuring performance and they're for another story. In the real work of making new businesses happen there's a million timing, resources and self-deprecating reasons why they're not in place right now.

Sometimes the best solution is to trust your and their gut feeling. Of all the experiences I've had in HR, the best way to know how an employee is feeling is to ask them. To unashamedly quote <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/harry-hill">Harry Hill</a>, 'you can tell a lot about a person from what they're like'
