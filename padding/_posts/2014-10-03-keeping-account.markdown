Understanding the overall finances of any company is essential to knowing what's actually happening. It's as simple as that.

Factory Five has had a strong set of accounts since day one and for this I've CEIBS to thank. Most people stop at the P&L, especially within corporations who don't reveal everything to it's management layer. Whilst the P&L does tell a good story for managing a department or a product line - it is only half the story of business performance. 

Here's our journey through new busines acccounting.

<strong>Pen and Paper</strong>

For the first year we did everything on paper. We tracked orders on one clipboard, purchases on another and what was left over at the end of the month was profit. It was simple and beautiful and completely unscalable.

By the time we had a dozen orders on the board and 100 items in inventory things started to slip. An order would go missing, a deposit would be forgotten and nothing was matching up correctly.

<strong>Pivots and Excel</strong>

So I created a series of excel sheets. They revolved around a core log of activity in and out of a number of buckets, effectively an Income Statement. Each bucket represents an account or asset, cash on hand, paypal, inventory and fixed assets (we hardly have any - some tools and a fridge).

Then it's just a case of logging everything correct with as much categorisable information as possible. I placed every transaction against a date, an area of the business, an account and a customer or supplier. That way with a series of smart pivot tables our entire business history could be filtered down into meaningful data.

Then comes the basic accounting principles of double entry accounting. When you purchase inventory, cash goes down and inventory goes up. What's left at the end of the month is profit. It's beautiful, scalable, tremendously laborious and requires absolute concentration to avoid mistakes.

<strong>Clouds and trust</strong>

18 Months later we have 6,000 rows in an excel worksheet and a system which allows only one user and requires meticulous attention to maintain. After plenty of research we went with <a href="http://www.xero.com/">Xero</a>. It is probably the most comprehensive yet intuitive cloud based subscription service available.

Based around invoices and purchases it matches our workflow, doesn't allow incorrect records to be made and forces the right data to be recorded. To be honest it's slower than excel but an absolute gift in every other way. I have to admit I love it, but still write everything back into my excel pivots - for sentimental safekeeping!

Meaningful data

At the end of the day though, it's all about meaningful data. It is essential for the leaders of all businesses to know what's going on under the hood. Even as a small business we are processing hundreds of records every day and there's meaningfulness to extract and interpret on many levels. When that month comes when year on year profits are double but operating expenses are triple, there's no excuse to guess the reason why, it should be there in black and red.
