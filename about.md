I came to Shangahi in 2009. Five years puts me directly in the category of been here long enough to scratch the surface but not so long that I've gone full native and forgotten where the surface is.

I founded and partner [Factory Five][Factoryfive], write pretty regularly about restaurants for Cityweekend, have one architectâ€¦ and three cats.
