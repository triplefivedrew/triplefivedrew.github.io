In 2009 I gave up a cushy number in London’s advertising scene and moved to Shanghai to test the senses in another corner of the world. I write mostly about photography, fixed gear rolling, food and getting knee deep in China’s super-city. I’m a simple animal; give me a couple wheels and a pair of chopsticks and we’re off.

I founded and partner [Factory Five][Factoryfive], write pretty regularly about restaurants for Cityweekend, have one architect… and three cats.
