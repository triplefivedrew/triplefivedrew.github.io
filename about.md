I came to Shangahi in 2009. Five years puts me directly in the category of been here long enough to scratch the surface but not so long that I've gone full native and forgotten where the surface is.

After a couple years at [CEIBS][CEIBS] I figured I'd been given a golden ticket and enough textbooks to do anything with my career. One day, after a long ride and before a big beer something clicked.

Jeff and Tyler and I started [Factory Five][factoryfive] in 2010. We're business partners, close friends and in my opinon talented people who become more talented when we're together.

Starting a business in Shanghai is the most exciting and daunting thing I have ever done. I've come to realise that being a true entrepreneur means you never really feel like one. The lessons never stop and neither do the questions.

Stick with me and I'll tell you a story or two. It's what I'm learning from the front line of running a bicycle business in China... or really any new business anywhere in the world.

Where to start? How about... [how it all got started][firstpost].
