The act of purchasing is as significant to many consumers as posessing the actual product. That feeling of receiving a focussed service which is there to help you through a transaction is often overlooked as a marketing and satisfaction tool. When it is used effectively, it can be very impactful.

Take the very successful Hot Pot Restaurant chain <a href="http://www.haidilao.com/index.html">HaiDiLao</a>. They sell mediocre food at reasonable prices with the added gimmick that you get popcorn, internet terminals, massages and manicures whilst waiting for a table to become available. Except it's not a gimmick. They've turned a queue into a product and the process of purchasing a meal has turned into an experience of satisfaction.

Another curious example is Amazon Prime. Normally you buy an item online, choose an optimum shipping/price bracket and then wait for the product to arrive. For a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/prime?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0">fixed yearly fee</a> Amazon will give unlimited free express delivery. Let's be honest, we don't really need that item tomorrow and Amazon gives free slow-poke delivery anyway. What is really happening is Amazon demonstrating their competency in enhancing your purchasing process.

This potential for process satisfaction is heightened in the realm of custom products. The truth is that people actually expect it. Knowing that something is being custom-made means I want to be even more immersed in what is going on.

Which is why we say absolutely the wrong thing at Factory Five. We tell customers "okay, your order is finalised. We'll tell you when it's almost ready and you can come and pick up it up". What they want to hear is "we'll tell you every step of the way what is going on so that you're involved in the process". Let's face it, having something custom made is bound to be excited - why keep it under wraps?

The truth is that it's only really a question of two elements; resources and supply chain. Firstly unless it's a mostly automated notification system (+ wish-list) then it takes time, admittedly not too much, to inform people what's happening with enough detail to make it meaningfull. The second is more tricky, in a world (china) where suppliers will never agree to a deadline we're not as comfortable as we'd like to be with shipments. Perhaps that's a good enough reason to hire for customer service and switch suppliers!
