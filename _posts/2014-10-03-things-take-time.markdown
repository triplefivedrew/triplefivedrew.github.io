If we look back at every project deadline we've set in the company - we've missed 100% of them. From building the eCommerce platform to developing prototypes to finding a company to supply water. Everything. Doing things for the first time adds a lag beyond any regular comprehension.

In the world of acquisitions, purchase amounts are often larger than the calculated market value of the company. The additional amount shows on the balance sheet as an almost intangible 'goodwill'. I'd like to suggest that first-time projects need to add a variable called '<em>timewarp</em>'.

This is not a simple 10% increase to cover any overage. It's more like adding 10% on to every individual doing every action in every step of the process. Here's where timewarp originates for new companies:

1) As a small team with only a few dependents (suppliers) we are constantly running at capacity. It's true that when we aren't moving forwards the company isn't moving forwards. 

2) It's human nature to focus on the path of least resistance. We defer to those projects which are easier to do (have been done before) and the result is that the ones that are more viscous (new) become a problem best left for the future.

3) Built into our strategy are principles that screw us over in the long run. We'll ensure a customer request or order gets the top priority over everything else. The more we grow, the more we'll have jobs to get in the way of new projects.

The honest truth is that there are hundreds of things we could be working on right now. The ones that make it to completion are the best and should have been worth waiting for. Probably, though, they're the source of taking a company to the next level.
