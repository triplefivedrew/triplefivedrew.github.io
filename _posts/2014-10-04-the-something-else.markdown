Distance in business can be measured on a number of axis other than physical mileage. Language, service, payment and positioning also weigh in on the argument. Online tech has reduced these distances enough to make direct sales a credible option. Why pay a middle man retailer to represent, sell and support my products to the customer when I can do it better myself?

Sounds great. Except when actual geographical distance gets in the way. Which it <a href="/index.php/shipping-from-china/">does for us</a>.

Which is why we need to develop channels to smoothly roll our products out to where they're going to be going. Essentially this means warehousing or distributing in popular or far away locations; Europe, USA, Russia. We need to arrange a basket of products which is big enough to economize on shipping but small enough that it doesn't start to incur additional costs such as storage or big-box leakage (items in large volumes have a tendency to grow legs).

It's no easy task, predicting what the market might want, positioning and getting it to them. Actually what we need is a man on the ground at each location who understands all this. Step in the retailer.
