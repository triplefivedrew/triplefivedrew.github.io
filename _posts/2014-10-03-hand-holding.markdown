I never realized just how much effort it takes to help customers choose which products they want to buy.

For every person who walks in with enough information to make a purchase, there are 10 who need help to make a few key decisions. Half of them know they want to buy something... but have no idea what it is yet.

The best one is the guy who walks in and says 'sell me something'.
I guess it's a reality ....
