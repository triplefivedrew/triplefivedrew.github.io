Our online store has been running for eight months. We designed and built it in house, stocked the virtual shelves and then opened with no big idea of who would walk through the door.

We knew visitors would split between domestic and international. We knew customers would mostly be males aged 18-35 and that most of our interaction would be in english regardless of their location. Our site is written in English even though it is technically bilingual and most of the F5 Story so far has been this way too.

At first both domestic and international orders were slow... but in recent weeks we've been getting increased hits and orders from overseas. Why this is happening is probably a combination of momentum, seasonality and strong presence on international sites.

What this means is that we now need to ship products to many destinations outside China.

It sounds like a simple process; Find a shipping company or agent, negotiate their rate-card and build it into the online store. Then every day just box orders up with the address written on the side and wait for the delivery guy to come and collect. 

In truth, it is a massive ballache:

1) Rules keep changing. In 2012 prices were based on package weight within sizing categories. Now calculations are based on volumetric weight. A 50x50x50cm box that weighed 5kg would have a billable weight of 5kg before. Now it is based on a billable volume (which by FedEx's benchmark is assumed to be 200kg per cubic metre). The 50x50x50cm box is 1/8th of a metre so has a billable weight of 25kg.

2) Agents in China are almost entirely useless. They'll not show up some days. They'll never give you an up front price. They'll rarely follow up with tracking codes and you'll be left wondering if they're providing a good service or not.

3) Shippers in China love to chuck stuff around. We see it when suppliers deliver boxes to us by dragging them behind their scooter. Thank god we are now being charged based on potential volume because we're adding 2KG of padding to every frame. Customs are the worst, they inspect boxes using a crowbar.

4) On Customs... they are the unseen dickheads. Their latest stipulation is that we're only allowed to send items which are either brandless or from brands that originate in China. A package of ours including a Brooks Saddle was recently refused because it 'clearly contained counterfeit goods'.

5) Items rarely get lost. Instead they slip off the radar for a few days until you chase every day for a week. Then they pop into existence and carry on their journey. Very suspicious.

So, how do we get around it? Until there's a fully cloud-based outsourced solution (or we're big enough to fill trucks on a daily basis and make the shipping companies some proper dollars), this is our current strategy:

a) Either find a good agent or be ready to commit to monthly volume with a big shipper (FedEx, TNT, DHL). We have an agent that aggregates enough to get a significant discount on FedEx's rack rate. A good agent is one that can give you a firm idea of price beforehand (i.e. a usable rate card) and a tracking code immediately after the package has left. Customer need to see a tracking code or they think it never happened. Rightly so.

b) Look for specialists. If you are targeting a specific type of customer in a particularly curious region there's bound to be a guy who's job it is to find the most effective and legitimate way to get a container in there. We have a separate company to use exclusively with Russian packages, most companies don't like to touch Russia, or Brazil.

c) Have one person in the company deal entirely with shipping. Create a role if you need to and hire someone. With the added dimension of outbound logistics, the order process takes on a layer of complexity that needs to be managed. In the early days we had a frame once arrive to USA and it's fork arrived in Seoul... an expensive and time-sensitive mistake.

d) Take a hit. Thanks to Amazon Prime and hourly inter-Europe flights, customers have a figure for shipping in mind. If your number is much more than theirs then they'll consider your product too expensive. If the business is worth having then a never-seen gesture of paying some of the cost may just be the clincher.

Above all, only ship internationally if the business is worth having. There are enough costs of trading overseas and geographic is only the longest. Consider if it's all worth it.

As we're growing we are monitoring where orders are coming from (and where interest is coming from - those two are not necessarily the same) and planning to open regional hubs to help keep stock closer to customers - which is a whole other ballgame for another post.
