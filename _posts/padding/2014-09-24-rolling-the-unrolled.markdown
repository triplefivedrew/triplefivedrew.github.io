None of us have worked in the bike or sports or retail or lifestyle or events or manufacturing industry before. Jeff was an electrical engineer, Tyler an architect and I worked in media.

We all lived around bikes though and this is what brought us together. We thought we had the right pieces of the puzzle to make a boostrap business work... category knowledge, passion, good contacts and a strong product. In 2010 [Factory Five][factoryfive] was born without looking back.

For the record, we started as five people working part-time for five months. The others didn't have a long-term view on our prospects and jumped-ship at the first road-bump. We three took it on full time with almost zero capital.

From then until now we've been on an exploration through uncharted China. We've set up a structure, formed a product portfolio and built a retail business that is somehow far more than just a retail business.

Luckily none of us had any of that physical experience. Beyond everything else we trusted our intuition to do what feels right.

In truth we're good story tellers. This is the business story of Factory Five.
