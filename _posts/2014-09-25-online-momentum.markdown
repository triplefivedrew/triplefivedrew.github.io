People can be so fickle. We've got so many inputs jumping in front of our faces. All we can do is react to what's right in front of our eyes.

Who can blame us? Buzz (aka popularity) is most accurately measured as a function of reach, engagement and time. It is the present that matters. Unless we're very diligent with the content we expose ourselves to then last week's news was never seen. In fact platforms incentivise adding more friends, extra feeds, essentially more influences. We are effectively increasing the volume of content received whilst ratcheting up the effects of buzz.

Which means that attention has a finite but intense window in which we're seeing the threads of content which are buzzing the most around us.

If buzz refers to a single content thread then I pose that momentum is impact on the story teller. Simply put; if what that guy said before was in my attention window then it must be of interest so what he's saying now is likely to be worthy of my attention too.

Thank god for online analytics and real time information. This chart represents one month of activity in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Factory-5/129909687076849">F5 Facebook Page</a>. The bars are the number of content posts we made to the page that day, and the line is the volume of activity we received from viewers. 

The obvious correlation is 'make more posts, receive more activity' but slightly more subtly is how quickly activity drops regardless. The pivotal factor here seems to be consistency.

Beyond getting excited about likes and watching how much traffic comes to our online store from Facebook we don't monitor the stats nearly enough. Over the coming weeks I'll be analysing the wealth of information that Google and Facebook provide... always with momentum in mind.
