People can be so fickle. We've got so many things jumping in front of our faces. All we can do is react to what's right in front of our fingers.

Who can blame us? Buzz (aka popularity) is most scientifically measured as a function of reach, engagement and time. It is the present that matters. Unless we're very diligent with the content we expose ourselves to, then last week's news will probably never be seen.

In fact, most platforms are constantly encouraging us to add more friends and extra feeds. They're pushing us to add more influences. We are effectively increasing the volume of content received and at the same time ratcheting up the effects of buzz.

Which means that the opportunity for attention has a finite but intense window in which we're seeing the threads of content which are buzzing the most around us.

So, if buzz refers to a single content thread then I pose that momentum is the impact of a single story teller... such as a brand. Simply put; if what that guy said before was buzzing enough to be in my attention window... then whatever he's saying now is likely to be worthy of attention too.

Thank god for online analytics and real time information. This chart represents one month of activity in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Factory-5/129909687076849">F5 Facebook Page</a>. The bars are the number of content posts we made to the page that day, and the line is the volume of activity we received from viewers. 

The obvious connection is 'make more posts, receive more activity' but slightly more subtly is how quickly activity drops regardless. The pivotal factor here seems to be consistency.

Beyond getting excited about likes and watching how much traffic comes to our online store from Facebook, we don't monitor the stats nearly enough. Over the coming weeks I'll be analysing the wealth of information that Google and Facebook provide... always with momentum in mind.
