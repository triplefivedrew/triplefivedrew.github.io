None of us have worked in the bike or sports or retail or events or manufacturing industry before. I was in media, Tyler an architect and Jeff a web designer.

We all lived bikes though and that's what brought us together. We thought we had the right pieces to make a business work; category knowledge, passion, good contacts and a strong product. In 2010 <a href="http://wearefactoryfive.com/">Factory Five</a> was born without looking back.

For the record, we started as five people working part-time. The others didn't think we had what it takes and when we hit the first road bump they jumped off. So, we three took it on full time and moved location.

From then until now we've been on an exploration through uncharted China. We've set up a structure, formed a product portfolio and built a retail business that is somehow more than just a retail business.

Luckily none of us had any of that physical experience. Beyond everything else we trusted our intuition to do what feels good.

In truth we're pretty good story tellers. This is my business story.
