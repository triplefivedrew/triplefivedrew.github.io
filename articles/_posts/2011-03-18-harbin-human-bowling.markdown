Here's the Sphinx slide at the <a href="http://www.triplefiveshanghai.com/harbin/">Harbin Ice Festival</a>. In the absence of an attendant to regulate traffic, visitors are free to chuck themselves down at will, with hilarious effect. 

From 55 yards away the screams are rising through the cold as the inevitable pile ups occur - they should really play bowling alley sound effects to drown them out. I managed to pull-off a 7-10 split by applying a touch of spin.
