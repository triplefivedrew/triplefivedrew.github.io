Yeah, making up their own freakytecture isn't enough, Shanghai has a penchant for the replica, like that freaking huge concrete <a href="http://www.triplefiveshanghai.com/shanghai-aircraft-carrier/">aircraft carrier</a> by the Dianshan Lake. Over on the western reaches of Hongqiao Road is a newly constructed Whitehouse behind a big boring wall. 

The guard outside wasn't too pleased to see us rolling by - and around - and back again, but I managed to hop the wall and grab a photo before he grabbed me by the scruff of my neck.
