We’ve just finished our latest fixed projects. These are a couple of new utility bikes made by Forever. Converted China Post Office and China Telecom frames. They look awesome, really vivid paint jobs and some awesome decals with golden characters and phoenix motifs.

I’ve now taken off the rear rack, was a little weighty and I might cut down the mud guard. The blue one has the fold down platforms which are hilarious. Need to find a longer post and maybe new seat, this one is as squeaky as a Victorian bed.

Also looking for a 1″ front fork that doesn’t extend the front wheel out quite so far.

Ride wise, really smooth. Great for cruising around the French concession and after running 46×13 on Ocean-san it’s easy wheel all the way.
