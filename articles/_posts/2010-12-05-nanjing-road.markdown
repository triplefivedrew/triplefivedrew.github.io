Maybe that was the last beautiful sunny weekend of the year but given that we're in December already, nobody's complaining. No better way to spend it than wandering the almost untouched hutong <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=nanjing+road&sll=31.230393,121.473704&sspn=0.850189,1.766052&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=China+Shanghai+Huang+Pu+Qu+Nan+Jing+Lu+Bu+Xing+Jie&ll=31.226986,121.457559&spn=0.003321,0.006899&z=17">behind Nanjing Road</a> that we've been calling the next Tianzifang for the past 6 months.

Fortunately it's nowhere near takiang Lu but does have a couple good offerings including a funky Taiwanese bar, a Feiyue store (or two) and plenty of people wandering around taking photos of the washing. I too obliged.
