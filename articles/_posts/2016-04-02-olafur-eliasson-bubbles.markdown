title: Olafur Eliasson, Happiness
oneline: Getting carried away by bubbles
excerpt:  Through a 10cm head-height slit in a 10 metre wall you're looking through at a single plane, entirely lit in blue, onto which bubbles are falling like snowdrops.

I got a little carried away one of Olafur Eliasson's works at the "Nothingness is not nothing at all" exhibition at the Long Museum. Here's my article on the whole exhibition.

The bubbles though. Through a 10cm head-height slit in a 10 metre wall you're looking through at a single plane, entirely lit in blue, onto which bubbles are falling like snowdrops.

That's all.
