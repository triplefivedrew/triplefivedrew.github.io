Off the track here, although worthy of mention is this article <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=107712007">Six Steps to a smaller carbon footprint</a> on the Scotsman.com. It starts with a well-intentioned guide to reducing the amount of planet earth we use on a daily basis... but is then completely dwarfed by the often scathing comments of a multitude of well spoken Scots, most of whom, like me, resent the horror-movie the media has made of the subject.

best comment so far: #25: Give us all night vision glasses then we can all be in our houses at night in the dark. Also no TV available after midnight. And of course no holidays that involve any form of traveling. Problem solved Leave normal living to the Chinese etc.
