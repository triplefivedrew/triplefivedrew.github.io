Shanghai has a Beach! Right on the Bund next to the ironically named Cool Docks is a man made plot of imported sand - it's sandwiched in between a parking lot and the entrance to the pleasure-port.

For 20RMB you can lay back on a lounger, listen to the car-horns, soak in the view of construction across the water and contemplate what the city has become... and where it's going.
