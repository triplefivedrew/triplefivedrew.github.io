The last time we went to Carlton Towers I was young enough that I can't remember it. A few weeks ago was my cousin's wedding and we spent a couple of days there that I'll never forget. Thanks to the power of television there are two words which will put it entirely into perspective.

Carlton Towers is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Towers">Victorian country house</a> in the middle of the North Yorkshire countryside. It is currently occupied by LordÂ Gerald Fitzalan-Howard... and the occasional wedding party. I got up in the morning, snuck around in my socks with the dogs and snapped a few shots before heading out for a morning jog through the grounds.
