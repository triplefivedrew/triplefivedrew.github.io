<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I’m not sure when we actually agreed to this but on Sunday, November 29th, Alex and I will wake up, have a bowl of porridge and go for a 4-5 hour, 42km <a href="http://www.shmarathon.com/">run around Shanghai</a>.</span>

In our last race, the <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/?p=381">Hangzhou half marathon</a>, my broken toe almost <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/?p=211">fell off</a>, Alex’s mission control unit (iPod) almost ran out of batteries and for the final 5 km the voice in our heads was chanting “wait here, why go on? take a break!”

This time we’re only running twice as far(!), so I’ll be using more toe-tape, the iPod will be fully charged and we will combat the stopnow-devil with the thought of making a difference for something very close to our hearts.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystonia">Dystonia</a> is a neurological movement disorder which may affect anyone at any age causing repetitive muscle contractions. It touches many thousands of people, our family included, and as a syndrome, often cannot be attributed to a single cause. To this day there exists no successful treatment.

We will be running on behalf of <a href="http://www.dystonia.ie">Dystonia Ireland</a> who are working to support, educate and raise awareness for the condition. We will be propelled along by every penny we can pound in their name.
