Last week I went to the Stampede Kart track and on my bike took on a go-kart, a Sherpa's guy, a runner and a dude on heel-wheels.
It was a 5 lap race - who won? Well I didn't - the Kart obviously did. I comfortably took second. <a href="http://www.cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/articles/blogs-shanghai/shanghai-sports/formula-fun-we-host-our-own-f1-race-ahead-real-event/">Here are the results and a full race review.
