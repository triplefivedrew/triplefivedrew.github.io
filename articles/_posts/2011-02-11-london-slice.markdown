We only had chance for a couple days in London this time. Just enough to slip in lunch at <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/taste-great-queen-street/">Great Queen Street</a>, sunsets in the Barbican, a cheeky half in Soho and a proper hug with some proper friends.

... and a glance of <a href="http://www.triplefiveshanghai.com/taste-les-trois-garcons/">Les Trois Garcons</a> (next time!)

With proof-of-concept of the power of fleeting moments with the best country in the world, we've decided to bring little slices of it to Shanghai. Coming soon: triplefivecrumpets.com
