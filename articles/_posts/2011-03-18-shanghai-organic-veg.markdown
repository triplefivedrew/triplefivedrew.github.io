We made an order with <a href="http://www.shorganic.com">Shanghai Organics</a> and two days later this arrived.

China's approach to organic is similar to UK in 2005; heavy branding, separate display stands and a big price hike... all to shed commodity status for what, if we're honest, should be a commodity in the first place.

It's a shame to see this local delivery company is on the same footing, I've never seen such over-packaged vegetables before. We ordered 8 onions and each came on its own tray wrapped in cling film.They have offered to send the next batch unwrapped but that should really be as standard. When people think organic they're also thinking about sustainability.

But yes the tomatoes do taste a million times better. Here's hoping Shanghai has a speedy transition to organic as standard so all we have to remove is the vine.
