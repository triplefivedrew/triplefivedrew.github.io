After a few days of locking umbrellas with the locals we were positively Pavlovian at the prospect of being out on the open water. Thanks to <a href="http://www.tomeatsjencooks.com/">Tomeat's</a> company Junk and a clued-in captain we cruised north-east around Kowloon to the peaceful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Water_Bay">Clearwater Bay</a>.

Anchor down and what followed was some rooftop bombs, diving practice and general monkeying around in the shallows. Eventually the clouds rolled in and the heavens opened, we cruised back to Central in pounding black-rain and set foot on land just as Typhoon T5 was announced. Wonderful.
