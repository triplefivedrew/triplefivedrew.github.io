Shanghai International Circuit, about an hour North West of the city, has it's own subway station, Chinese character style layout ('Shang' ä¸Š) and hoards of touts who will get you through the turnstyles with a vendor's badge if you grease their palms with a fistful of red notes.

Supposedly lots of tickets are given away to locals who aren't interested in the slightest (a pity - they could certainly learn a thing or two about driving) and so there's plenty of opportunity to turn up and stroll in (after the customary banter).

We'll be heading back there tomorrow to see if Button and Hamilton can sneak around the Red Bulls. The forecast says rain so there's plenty of chance for excitement.
