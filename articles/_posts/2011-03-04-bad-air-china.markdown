oneline: Maybe it was because I had to fly via Beijing to Dubai for
    10 hours or maybe they were terrible. No, they were terrible.

There’s nothing worse than a blow by blow account of a bad experience so I’ll keep this brief. Return flight to Dubai from Shanghai via Bejing. 4 legs all delayed at around 3hrs each. Connections missed. In flight service bad. Ancient entertainment system and shuttle buses everywhere because they’d rather park in the cargo terminal.

After being sat for 7 hours they brought me this for breakfast.
