Every so often, Alcatraz hospital is opened for public viewing. We were on a tour of the island and lucky enough to be there on one such day.

It's a truly eye opening experience. This was a facility for keeping notoriously troublesome life-convicts healthy without letting them get hold of anything sharp or dangerous. It's somehow surprisingly bleak and haunting, I can only imagine how rudimentary their methods were. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stroud">Robert Stroud, 'the Birdman Of Alcatraz'</a>, spent most of his sentence in a room here. It looks more like the set from a horror movie - having been left in it's decaying 1950's decoration.
