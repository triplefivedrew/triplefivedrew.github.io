In 10 hours of Dubai I’ve seen more food than I could possibly eat at the global food convention in which nations come together trying to swap everything from fresh lamb to cheese football and the Germans linger with their massive stainless processing, mixing, packaging and toasting apparatus. It was all too much to photograph.

The last time we came to the ‘biggest at everything’ city it was a mess of skyscrapers, cranes and ambitious motorways. A few years on and it’s the same story except that the 0.8km tall Burj Khalifa is finished and the palms are slightly washed away. Give me the <a href="http://www.triplefiveshanghai.com/shanghai-world-financial-center/">big bottle opener</a> and a cage of Xiao Long Bao any day.

38 hours of travel in 3 days for a morning meeting… and a little go-karting. Entirely <a href="http://www.triplefiveshanghai.com/bad-air-china/">let down</a> by Air China at every step of the way.
