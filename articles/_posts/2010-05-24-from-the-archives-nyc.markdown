This time last year we were on holiday in New York, soaking up the city without office catchups and sales meetings. Bliss.

This photo is of Monet’s Water-Lily Pond in the MoMA. On Wednesday evenings admission is free and the gallery takes on lively atmosphere. These three ladies sat here chatting for the two hours we were there.

I was really surprised to see how many people were taking photos, something distinctly banned in London’s galleries. Camera’s are barely even allowed onto Naoshima. I have to wonder what the rule in Chinese cinema’s is. “wash hands before handling artwork”?
