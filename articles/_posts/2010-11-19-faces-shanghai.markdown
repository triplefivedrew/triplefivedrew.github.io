With friends in town we revisited the back-streets of old Shanghai.

After a time, the culture shock of stinky tofu, yelling for no reason and homes made from spit & newspapers begins to wear off. It has started to seem normal behaviour to wander around in pyjamas and get live frogs skinned on-demand. The truth is, and whilst we were in no misconception otherwise, no matter how you cook your eggs – life is the same – whether you’re out for a stretch, scolding your kids for being mischievous or watching the world go by.

I went out and had a shot at capturing the people Shanghai – all 18 million of them (or a handful).  You’d never guess it from their faces but they like their eggs with tomato, scrambled and covered in sugar.
