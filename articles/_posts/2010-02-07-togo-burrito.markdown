Otherwise entirely anonymous, in the back of a print shop on Wulurmqi Lu, Steve Burrito makes the best underground burritos in Shanghai. Actually he makes the best burritos in Shanghai. He offered us an off-menu special last weekend and we gorged until bursting point on ribs, rib tacos and rib burritos. Want to go? Ready when you are.
