Every so often a build comes around at Factory Five that I love. Actually, this happens quite a lot... we try to steer people away from circus bikes.

This is up there in my absolute favorites, assembled around the F5100 frame it packs a heap of top-shelf goodies into an 8kg build. It's dark, stealthy, obsidian and that high-gloss smooth-weld finish is pristine.
