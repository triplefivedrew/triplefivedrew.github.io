Flying home for Christmas. Below, Siberia stretches to the horizon, a million snowy, peaceful, untouched peaks.

Seems the right moment to reflect on the year; snowboarding in Japan, graduating an MBA, a spell in banking, touring Spain, showing family our city, home-made bacon, paradise in Vietnam, special people, starting Factory Five and making it back to Yorkshire after a couple of years away... all to the rhythm of Shanghai in the worlds most talked about country.

Wishing you a very Merry Christmas, a peaceful boxing day and for me; the time to sit & write.
