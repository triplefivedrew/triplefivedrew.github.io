Thanks to some expert googlemok we've found an actual running club without a drinking problem(!). They're called <a href="http://www.yiqipao.com/">YiQiPao</a> - "Together Run". Today we ran at a leisurely 10km/h with a group of 30 along the path of next weekend's <a href="https://www.nike.com.cn/chinarun/">Nike 10k</a>. The pace still had me sweating buckets - not sure when my body is going to adjust to running in 28°c.

Afterwards we ate one of our top 5 meals so-far in the middle of nowhere and tried out speaking some chinese.  The response was unexpected - people could actually tell what I was saying! We rolled home happily exhausted, completely stuffed and only 22RMB lighter.
