So we've agreed to look after a couple of kitties for a few weeks until their new owners are able to take them. They're 7 weeks old - slightly ferrel and a little scrawny.

To begin with there was plenty of hissing and <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/introducing-larry/">Larry</a> tracked their every move from a distance. <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/introducing-lady/">Lady</a> on the other hand was petrified of them and sulked in the bedroom. A few days later and they've eated 10 pouches of whiskers, bonded with Larry and are generally steering clear of Lady who is still under the bed... sneaking out to the toilet when the coast is clear.
