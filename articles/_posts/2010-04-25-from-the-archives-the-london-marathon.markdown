Kebede crossed the line in an unimaginable 2h05 in today's London Marathon.

Everybody knows, however, that the real race is within the costume categories. As the <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/news/823216-thousands-brave-rain-to-run-london-marathon">Metro</a> reported: "<em>The fastest runner dressed as an animal was Kevin Robins, coming home in three hours, 30 minutes and one second while dressed as tiger. The 33-year-old from Sevenoaks said he was racing against a lobster who was also going for the record, and had feared the lobster would overtake him right at the end.</em>"  

That's a shot from 2006, at the last corner. At the time we were shouting at him to get on with it and finish - only after taking 10 minutes to run the last 200 metres in <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/?p=411">Shanghai</a> do I know what he was going through.
