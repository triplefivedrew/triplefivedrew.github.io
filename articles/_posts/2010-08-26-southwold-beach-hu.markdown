Southwold. Picturesque village of two dozen seafood restaurants, the <a href="http://adnams.co.uk/">Adnams</a> brewery and beach huts that sell for thirty thousand pounds. 

Nothing expresses the Englishman's love for the sea more than how much we're willing to pay for a two square meter shed in which to eat our fish and chips.

It's the same at all points of the British coast. A hut in Dorset <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-422418/Beach-hut-sells-250-000.html">sold for £250k</a>. That's up the luxury end, though, with electricity and running water. £30k just get's you four walls and space for a deckchair or two.

An hour or two with a paper breathing in the fresh sea air and the price might not sound too crazy. Convinced? Sign up to <a href="http://www.beach-huts.com">www.beach-huts.com</a> and be prepared for a five year wait.
