If you say the word 'expat', within 30 seconds someone will say '<a href="http://www.cityshop.com.cn">city shop</a>'. It's basically Shanghai's answer to Whole Foods and is full of western families, their screaming blond kids and their bemused ayi.

Ok, we have snuck in here for a baguette and boneless chicken breast from time to time but the prices are laughable.

Where else in the world are you going to pay Â£10 for a box of Alpen? Switzerland maybe.
