Underneath the elevated metro, next to a busy Hong Qiao intersection and backing onto a park is this half-shed, half-bar, all-intimate music venue.Â <a href="http://www.yuyintang.org" target="_blank">Yuyintang</a> is one of those little Shanghai secrets that everyone knows about; voted Time Out's <em>best live rock bar 2009</em>.

If you're into experimental music played badly then head right in. If you prefer it a little less experimental and in-time then head to the bar for a 25RMB whisky sour and give it a minute - who knows!

Afterwards pop out of the back and enjoy some street-fried-rat in the park. Just don't go into the outdoor toilets whatever you do. The communal toilet-seat-stool by the door should be enough of a deterrent.
