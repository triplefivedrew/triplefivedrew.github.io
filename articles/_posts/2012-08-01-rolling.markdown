So I've been rolling hard recently. If you didn't know already we launched <a href="http://www.wearefactoryfive.com">Factory Five</a> for real at the end of last year and we got mad busy. Thinking of starting a site called the 'Reluctant Entrepreneur'

I've got a backlog as long as your arm of things to write about and a dossier of anti-tourism that needs to be released before I explode. Don't even mention the photographs. They're not going to edit and tag themselves.

Stay frosty.
