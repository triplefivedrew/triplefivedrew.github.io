70 million years ago a meteor hit China 100km west of where the world's largest city would be. It filled with water, got connected to Beijing by the world's longest man-made canal and then pumped almost entirely full of the byproducts of industrial progress.

<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/QgoMm">Tai Lake</a> is a huge, almost superlatively huge with the promise of lazy islands, expanses of water and country life, despite a surrounding population of 30 million people. With <a href="http://missionworkshop.com/">Mission Workshop</a> and <a href="http://prollyisnotprobably.com/">John Prolly</a> in town on our Yangtze Delta tour, we continued the trip over from Suzhou, having <a href="/blog/city-rolling-suzhou/">rolled there from Shanghai</a> a couple days before.

The approach from Suzhou is 40km of straight, suburban roads and towering malls. Light industry kicks in before reaching the lake and becomes almost steampunk wild-west through a barren and dusty town. We popped out onto the water's edge next to a huge, static waterwheel.

Along the side of the lake and things take a turn for the better. We slipped around to the shoulder-less and slightly hairy bridges and burst onto the XiShan island with a wild huger.

After rolling the island's mostly flat circumference, we hit gold and thanks to a very well-connected member of the group managed to get up the normally foot-traffic-only Xishan Mountain for some wonderful views across the water and empty rolling twists through the tea groves.

Here's the <a href="http://app.strava.com/activities/46295473">route we took</a> from Suzhou, around XiShan island and off to our Resort hotel for a much needed dip in the hot springs.
