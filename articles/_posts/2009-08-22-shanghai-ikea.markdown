I heard it was true but we had to go check it out for real. People in Shanghai go to Ikea to hang out on the sofas and sleep in the beds.

These aren't people waiting for their friends to browse around - every single chair or bed has someone in it. Mostly asleep. Some playing mah-jong at the kitchen tables.

Otherwise the furniture is the same, layout the same, food; same. Trolley full of candles: check!

ps: thank's Tom - it's all true: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-china-ikea25-2009aug25,0,7736661.story">http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-china-ikea25-2009aug25,0,7736661.story</a>
