<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:100%;">Mexico DF is the world's third most populous city and that's no lie. Flying in on the plane a blanket of urban developments spreads hazily to all points on the horizon punctured only by a scattering of mini-mountains rising out of the haze.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:100%;">The city has an unkempt ambiance. People here seem to relish living in unfinished property. Everywhere rusty reinforcing poles jut out from un-clad concrete buildings like the third world fallout from a long finished war.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:100%;">Crime is reportedly high across the district, 'dont take the green cabs' we're warned by hotel concierge. Shame because the comedic beetles are rattling around everywhere and add a strangely fun element to western eyes. I wasn’t party to any of the horror stories from a friend of a friend – actually we were very well looked after and the population came across friendly and welcoming.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:100%;">This week the project kept us mostly on our toes during the days. Any daylight experiences came only from the rush-hour crawl across town to the office, in the evenings was a better chance to explore. Nothing really stands out about this city... unless you're interested in tequila (or its older, rougher brother; mescal). We were taken to a bar selling only the latter from an almost medical-counter bar and savored the mind numbingly (literally) different preparations and flavors.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:100%;">The weekend offered an opportunity to take a day trip and we opted for the pyramids at Teotihuacan. Another day and I would have liked to re-visit the monstrous street market and highly acclaimed museum of anthropology.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:100%;">Mexico DF's is a vast city with all the trappings of a populous Latam capital without any of the attractive features. I can’t help but feel that after a week I'd have seen everything; however the vast Mexican countryside and coastline may have offered the positive alternative. </span>
