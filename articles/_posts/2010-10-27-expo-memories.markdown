As an indication of how hygienic the country is - these were plastered all over staff bathrooms in the Expo. If USA can write "employees mush wash hands before returning to work" everywhere - China can go one better!

Of particular value is the list of when to wash your hands, the last point is "whenever hands are dirty". Pure revelation.

I wonder how many people followed the final instruction "rub hands with no-rinse alcohol gel for about 30 seconds until the alcohol evaporates" guess none.
