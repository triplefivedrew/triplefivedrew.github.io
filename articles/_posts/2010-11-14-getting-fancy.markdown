To celebrate Alex winning another bike in the <a href="http://peoplesbike.com/pplsen/?p=5138">Shanghai Alleycat</a> (and because it was halloween) we smacked it in C's with a brummie Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a guy who's freckles bleed one day every year and a Teletubby.

The result, a pretty hilarious night with pretty much everybody in the place taking it in turns to don the Teletubby outfit and bust out a few moves as the crowd cheered.
