I've already fawned enough over the Zhengzhou Le-Mer. If you didn't read <a href="http://triplefiveshanghai.com/zhenzhou-le-meridien/">that post</a> already then I gushed something about how the hotel represents the future of what a hungry re-emerging country can do with wealthy benefactors and good people.

All that being said, the hotel also has some pretty awesome furniture inside. It's like a Vitra hospice, around each every corner is an award-worthy article barely touched. It's no secret although I'll get in trouble to say that <a href="http://en.neriandhu.com/">NHDRO's</a> fairer, simpler half is a furniture creation and import business called <a href="http://www.thedesignrepublic.com/">Design Republic</a>. When the two come together magic happens.

Here's a few of the pieces inside the hotel. Seriously, if you're ever in ZZ, pop into their lobby lounge for a double-rainbow of furniture perfection.
