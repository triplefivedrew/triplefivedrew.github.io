I remember when Hong Kong was as different from England as I could fathom. Now a week there seems like a homecoming break from the intensity of Shanghai.

We took a roll around the Island, cruising through the mostly flat Sheung Wan, Kennedy Town and onto the undulations of Pok Fu Lam. The 46x11 ratio was complaining by Aberdeen and as we crossed back over to Happy Valley I managed a personal best - slowest 2km ever.

The island is not huge, with a couple hours and a few gears it would be on the cards to get all the way round. Aberdeen is probably not worth the trip but Hong Kong is not knee deep in skyscrapers as the dark side of the island suggests, there's some striking natural beauty - punctuated by a luxury apartment block overlooking the choice spots here and there. 

It did feel strange to descend out of a national park straight into lunch-hour Wan Chai. Within minutes we had Froyos in hand and the umbrellas to battle with.
