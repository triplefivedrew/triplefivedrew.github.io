Around the pond, "zaoshang hao" to the guards, across the pavement, through the roadworks, glide over freshly laid tarmac. Pause for the khaki traffic attendant, watch for the turning bus and the senseless pedestrians. Zig zag onto Xietu Lu, race the traffic for a few kilometres, along the road with no surface, dodge the manholes, the cranes and the rickshaws of shoes boxes. Around the shiny new metro station. Under the motorway bridge, over the dirt and against the traffic, pause for a pancake and onto the ferry.

Halfway there.
