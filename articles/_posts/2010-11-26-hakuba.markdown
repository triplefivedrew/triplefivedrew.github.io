This lucky boy got bought an extra special trip to Japan for Christmas. We'll be sliding through powpow, pulling into a natural onsen and being served green tea by snow monkeys. Might have to buy a new lens and definitely heading down to Kejiguan to top up on Spyder skipants. Any tips on Hakuba? ...let me know.
