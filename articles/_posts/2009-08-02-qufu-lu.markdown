I have never been so overwhelmed by clothes before. Oxford street, Bangkok Suann Lumm, TK Maxx and Belz all put together have nothing on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=106044707941414690987.00046f85f7ebcf6528a40&amp;ll=31.245994,121.471324&amp;spn=0.006568,0.013797&amp;z=16">Qipu Lu</a>.

Which of course is half the fun.</div>

Here at least a half-dozen huge buildings, each with 4 football pitch sized floors are crammed with 'boutiques' selling to the weekend shopper what they are normally churning out in bulk to the department stores.
