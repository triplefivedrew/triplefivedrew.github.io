We dropped by for a drink or two on the rooftop of <a href="http://waterhouseshanghai.com/">The Waterhouse</a>. It's certainly rather spiffing (not least because it's by Alex's <a href="http://www.neriandhu.com">firm</a>), essentially peeled back to the raw concrete and given a lot of attention with some mega furniture and marvelous sight lines and [zzsszzzzhhh, white archi-noise].

Good to see a Yorkshire boy done good, Jason <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Atherton">Atherton</a> (middle photo) keeping an eye on his kitchen. When the service picks up we'll be heading over there for some of Shanghai's sure to be finest gastro-fayre.
