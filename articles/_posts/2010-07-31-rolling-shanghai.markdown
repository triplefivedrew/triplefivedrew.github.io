We took a dash around Shanghai on a fine Saturday afternoon with thanks to Nate over at H.A.L. (I will write something for them one day) for organizing.

Was good to see Chris Trees on his Holdsworth tandem rolling circles around usâ€¦ and the sprint out to Fudan as the sun went down even put hairs on my Chest.

Was also good to be out on Ocean San after the last few weeks of commuting just 30k every day on the general. Nice to get over 20k/hour and not worry about becoming water-based in the heat.
