Beijing is 1000km from Shanghai, a couple hours in the air and <a href="http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/shanghai-beijing-bullet-train-start-running-june-679130">soon</a> to be a five hour train ride on the new <a href="http://www.triplefiveshanghai.com/hongqiao-railway-station/">bullet</a>.

As Spring drags itself over Winter, the snow in Northern China hangs on for a while. At this altitude the freezing-line  recedes across the countryside.
