I distinctly <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/?p=411">remember saying</a> never-again...but this is one we can't turn down. The photos say it all.

And so - the countdown begins. Here comes two months of preparation for the Great Wall Marathon. 42km along and around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang">Qin Shi Huang's</a> garden fence... steps and all.

They say it takes an hour or two longer than a normal marathon - having never run anything beyond a gentle slope before this is going to be a new experience.

Starting this weekend the gradient training starts. With Shanghai lacking any decent hills we're getting creative - early morning runs up the down escalator in Changle Lu station and fire escape stairwell sprints in Pudong.
