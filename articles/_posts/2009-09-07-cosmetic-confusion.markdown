You can more or less work out what something is in the supermarket based on recognition. Sure, every so often you take a gulp of cranberry juice and it turns out to be cranberry vinegar but most of the time it's got a picture on the side or something gives the game away. With toiletries that goes right out of the window. Everything comes in a white bottle with a brand name and unoffesive swoosh on the sticker. Showergel, soap, cleanser, washing up liquid, mosituriser etc are all the same . Suffice to say we've got 5 bottles of conditioner and a tub of denture glue on the bathroom windowsill going spare.
