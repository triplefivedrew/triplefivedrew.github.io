In the past couple months I've flown across London half a dozen times. It never fails to impress. There's something about crossing the Kent coast, seeing a hundred miles of green and then, swinging into view, begins the world's greatest city.

Landing into Heathrow, if you're lucky, you'll be stuck in a holding pattern and be circling around east London. Sit on the right hand side, that's where all the action is as the plan banks clockwise over the city. It must be a hundred times that I've thought about slipping out the back door with a parachute and landing on Victoria Park.

Here's where the Olympic Village has emerged. From a bunch of gas towers, train tracks and one significant hockey pitch has grown a rather large sporting neighbourhood. At it's centre - the relatively humble (The World's most eco-friendly) <a href="http://www.london2012.com/olympic-stadium">main stadium</a> stands out poised to be London's next landmark.

Spotting London's last landmark, Renzo Piano's <a href="http://the-shard.com/">The Shard</a>, teetering above the City on the other side of the Thames normally indicates approach for landing. As the plane makes a lazy descent across the middle of town you'll be treated to Canary Wharf, the South Bank, Piccadilly Circus, Westminster, Pimlico, Hyde Park and Hammersmith.

Assuming, that is, you're sat on the right. Otherwise, well, enjoy a bit of Brixton and maybe look out for deer in Richmond Park.
