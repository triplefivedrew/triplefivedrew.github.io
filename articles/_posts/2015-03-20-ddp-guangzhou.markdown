Large scale public architecture is a real hoot. Every city in the world is waking up to the magnetism of a cultural, functional landmark designed by an archtectural super star. Thanks to Zaha Hadid's recent addition, Seoul is right up there on the list.

Her shiny, panelled, organic geometric buildings have become a blueprint for urban development. They've come a long way. Back in 2010 we rolled through Guangzhou and landed one of Zaha's less successful instances - the <a href="http://triplefiveshanghai.com/articles/china/2010/09/26/zaha-hadid-guangzhou.html">Guangzhou Opera House</a>.

No such slips ups in Seoul. This is the perfect landmark. Striking, dominant and open for exploration... and being in an asian city, surrounded by enough expaneses of concrete to hold the masses...
