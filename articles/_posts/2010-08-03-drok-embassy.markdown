A couple weeks <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/moving-home-shanghai/">later</a> and we're all settled. It's a beautiful lowrise apartment block in my favourite part of the French Concession at Huaihai and Wanping.

Sure you'll have to see it for yourself but a few highlights; <a href="http://www.svenskttenn.se/">Svenskt Tenn</a>, 'Eames', <a href="http://www.degournay.com/">Degournay</a>, the world's smallest dishwasher, a room full of Bikes and a Japanese robotic toilet.
