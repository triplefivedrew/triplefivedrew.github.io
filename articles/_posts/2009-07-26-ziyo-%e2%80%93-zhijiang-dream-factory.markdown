Went to see <a href="http://wiki.rockinchina.com/index.php?title=Ziyo">Ziyo</a> last night at the <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=106044707941414690987.00046f85f7ebcf6528a40&amp;ll=31.402294,121.501923&amp;spn=0.209814,0.441513&amp;z=11">Zhijiang Dream Factory</a>. Much better than the description made them sound; “Blends rough reggae, sloppy jazz, punk rock and emo”. The young Debbie Harry lead singer got the otherwise statuesque (some sleeping!) crowd moving. Well worth a look up on their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ziyo">myspace page</a>.

Even better was the Linkin Park DVD giveaway during the changeover. When my number was called and a microphone thrust in my face I addressed the room “Women (we) xihuan (like) nimen (you all)!!”
