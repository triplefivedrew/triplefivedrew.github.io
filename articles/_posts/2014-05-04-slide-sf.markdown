After living for a while in Shanghai we all have to admit it's freaking flat. So flat that whilst on vacation in San Francisco, the idea of getting on a shopping bike in the rain and riding up the world's steepest city streets sounds like a dream. <a title="Argonaut Hotel" href="http://www.argonauthotel.com/" target="_blank">The Argonaut Hotel</a> is right at the bottom of a pretty big hill, and happens to have a few <a title="Public Bikes" href="http://publicbikes.com/" target="_blank">Public Bikes</a> for free rental so I waited until the rain was right at it's heaviest and put on a few too many layers of clothing for a session of the hardest climbing I've ever done (with a basket).

Let's just say it wasn't pretty... as my <a title="a rainy ride through SF" href="http://www.strava.com/activities/116972545" target="_blank">Strava logs</a> will show. However it was a beautiful way to see San Francisco from all angles. The feeling of grinding up a block or two and turning round to see the city fall away is spell binding. Which is probably why I celebrated finding the famous crooked street along Lombard by almost becoming a human landslide down it and then slipping with no grip <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/117600654" target="_blank">back up</a> against traffic like a Shanghai Salmon. It may look dry from the photos but that's merely an illusion.

Shedding layers into that convenient basket like a pro, all that was left was a downhill glide over to <a title="Mash SF" href="http://mashsf.com/" target="_blank">Mash SF</a> to talk <a title="Factory Five Lattice Chainrings" href="http://wearefactoryfive.com/f5-lattice-chainring.html" target="_blank">Lattice chainrings</a> and then around a couple more landmarks, including the beautiful <a title="Painted Ladies" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies" target="_blank">Painted Ladies.</a>Â They're worth one shot, or 0.5 shots without a blue sky - here's mine...

But what if you're not up for getting drenched or breaking yourself to climb the hills. How to get around? The tram silly. It's super-cool, especially the one which cruises alongside the water from fisherman's wharf and then all the way down Market Street to The Castro.
