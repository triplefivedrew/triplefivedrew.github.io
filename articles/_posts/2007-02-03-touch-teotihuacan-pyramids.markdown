One hour outside of Mexico DF is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions; Teotihuacán.<br />It features in all the brochures, things to do lists, suggested trips and concierge recommendations but with an early 9am visit it's possible to avoid the expected touristic influx and enjoy the place with anticipated calm.

the Teotihuacán people ran most of central Mexico in its early history. In 200BC or so they dragged together (literally) this large city and the 52 pyramids that surround it - reason not quite known.

A few civilizations including the Mixtec and Mayans enjoyed dancing around the pyramids a couple thousand years ago peacefully pleasing their gods. Then the Aztecs wade in and throw their severed heads down the many steps Apocalyto style. This didn't last too long before a civil uprising wiped the city out and left it in ruin.

The largest and most impressive feature is the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;q=Teotihuac%C3%A1n,+mexico&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;ll=19.694456,-98.844981&amp;spn=0.014505,0.035512&amp;t=k&amp;om=1">temple of the Sun</a>; third largest pyramid in the world, very worthy of a triumphant climb. By mid morning it and the other large pyrmaid (moon) look like a mucky pair of mole-hills covered in camera-toting ants.

Even though this is Mexico DF's largest attraction, Teotihuacan still feels largely untouched. Supposedly anything not in a red-clay colour has been restored but really its not impressive due to its detailed beauty (close-up the pyramids are quite ghastly) but the scale on which the city was built and the oft-badly answered question - why?

The crisp morning was definitely a good and earthly time to visit however the flat light, grey earth and even greyer-sky didn't help take a good photo. If you can stand the tourism a sunset image would better suit the long term record.<br />
