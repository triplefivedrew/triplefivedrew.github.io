After 3 weeks of play fighting, midnight racing and all-round sprattling... it’s time to say goodbye to Monster Truck and Pip. Now Larry can stop puffing herself out to 120% actual size and Lady might come out from under the bed… and we can get a good night’s sleep. That’s not to say they won’t be missed – for sure it has been a pleasure to have 4 colour co-ordinated kitties around the house.
