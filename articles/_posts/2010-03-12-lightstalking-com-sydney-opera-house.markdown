I made it into the www.lightstalking.com "<a href="http://www.lightstalking.com/sydney-opera-house">15 Unique Photos of the Sydney Opera House</a>".

I took this photo from my room at the Park Hyatt during a business trip around asia. It's a fantastic hotel - plummy australian's at their best and some of the best eggs benedict I've ever had - not to mention a fantastic view of the bridge, the opera house and downtown. Here's another shot from the balcony.
