Jiaozi are delicious. Not to be confused with wonton, huntun, xiaolongbao, shumai or gyoza... jiaozi are parcels of chinese goodness wrapped in flour-paper skins and flash boiled. These dumplings, if prepared well, provide the most simple and fresh taste in Chinese cuisine.

Our first attempt took a couple hours but turned out just right. We made pork, tofu/vegetable and pumpkin fillings, creating the skins from scratch...
