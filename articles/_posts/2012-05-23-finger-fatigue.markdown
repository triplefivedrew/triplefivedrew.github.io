This last month I've written 4 restaurant reviews, 2 newsletters, 10 food award summaries, 12 al-fresco recaps, 80 product entries, 555 emails and 0 posts on triplefiveshanghai.

I went on a riding trip around Snowdonia, headstone approving in Doncaster, a wedding in Cortona, a food mission in Borough market, a triathlon in Moganshan and a night race around Minghang.

I've been asked "how light is this bike?" twenty times, "how much are Brooks saddles" ten and "are you open today?" five. The answers are 'very', '780' and 'probably'.

I've two summer resolutions. The second is to be more zen-some in Shanghai traffic and the third is to make more lists.
