Well that wasn't so bad. 21km around the beautiful <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=hangzhou+china&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=20.902146,56.513672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Hangzhou,+Zhejiang,+China&ll=30.244758,120.143824&spn=0.02217,0.055189&t=h&z=14">Hangzhou lake</a>. A little more hilly than expected, we descended for 4km, passing the leaders on the other side charging back up. Then along the east side of the lake with a handful of hump-back bridges to roll with. I had enough energy at the end for a sprint as the rain started to fall.
