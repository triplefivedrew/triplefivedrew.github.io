If there's one thing I loathe (apart from the Shanghai driving style) it's when you don't post for a while, apologize publicly (as if that matters), declare that everything is going to change and then do nothing about it.

So none of that is going to happen. A new job, graduating an MBA, a few weeks in Europe and enough projects with Factory Five to fill evenings & weekends are plenty to to write on.  Not to mention the food - that's where all this started lest I forget.

Forget this ever got written (I'm going to delete it next week anyway). The summer hiatus is over. Assume that a few self-loathing promised have been made and prepare thine-self for the truth about Spanish cuisine and 3 Michelin Star experience we'll never forget.
