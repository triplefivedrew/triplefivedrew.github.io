A couple weeks ago was the F1 Grand Prix in Shanghai. We've been every year for the past five because it's one of the most accessible and cheapest F1 races in the world. I also harbor a boyhood fascination with cars. If engines and speed is cool to you, then there's no better feeling as a spectator than being stood looking at the F1 starting grid when the flag goes down.

Each year, through a mixture of luck and guile, we've managed to make it into the Grandstand and right opposite to the start line. I like to get there early enough to watch the build up. The pit stop practices, the last minute alterations, the driver's coach tour of the circuit and the hundreds of people who swarm the cars when they're lining up to start.
