Shanghai’s massive river is a disappointment in virtually all aspects except tourist photographs. Unless you’re overpaying for a cruise, jostling with the blue collars for pole position on the scooter-ferry or in the market for a laserlaser it’s barely worth mentioning.

There’s hope, however, in the work they’re putting into the north-side stretch that runs from the Lupu bridge westwards to below Xujiahui. It features a promising embankment of smooth walkways a freshly poured skate park, <a href="http://peoplesbike.com/pplsen/?p=5786">climbing wall</a> and some pretty awesome disused processing silos.

Odds of them becoming a feature vs levelled for housing? I’m saying 5:55.
