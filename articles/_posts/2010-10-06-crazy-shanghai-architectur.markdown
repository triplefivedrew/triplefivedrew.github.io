In China, we're no stranger to the dragon-condusing holes in buildings or the fascination with UFO-style platforms on the rooftops.. but this takes the biscuit.

Up by the creek on the corner of Changshou Lu and Wanhangdu Lu is a recently finished apartment complex with 15 stories of rock stuck to the side of it. Amazing.

It looks like it could be a massive climbing wall, or where someone left a tap to drip and it slowly solidified for 55 billion years. In reality it's just another Shanghai monstrosity that is so bad it's freaking awesome.

Rolling by - we stopped in the middle of the 6 lane junction, along with a handful of locals to gape up at it. There are actually rooms set into the rock face! We're definitely going back later to investigate more.
