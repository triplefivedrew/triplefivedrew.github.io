Earlier this year our family fulfilled a lifelong ambition to see the Grand Canyon. As far as superlatives go, they don't get much bigger than the Grand Canyon - the word's most famous rocks.

Yet, maybe because it's so well documented or maybe because you can't eat it, I wasn't all that excited about going. I couldn't have been more wrong.

The Grand Canyon is a huge crack in the ground. It's actually more of a gigantic slow motion slice... the result of a river washing down through particularly soft rock-bed. 230 miles of valley, worn down fairly uniformly over a blistering two billion years.

The way we see it through the photos and fly-by videos is like a huge range. Rising from the Colorado River basin with steep mountain sides painted with the layers of our planet's eons. It feels like it has emerged from the earth, rather than sunk into it. At least that's how we felt before going. Driving through the desert, approaching the Grand Canyon National Park from the south were were 5 miles out and wondering where it is.

Where it is and what it is makes the Grand Canyon more breathtaking than any photo could ever describe. The depth and scale of a gigantic tear in the ground feels incredibly monumental. Arriving to the area, you're stood at ground level on the Grand Canyon's rim, looking down into it and across the other side, where the flatness continues.

We stayed a whole day, zipping around to the different lookout points, each with virtually the same, phenomenal, belittling view of pure nature. As evening approached we pitched up on the edge for the greatest show of all, sunset over the Grand Canyon... and oh it was good!
