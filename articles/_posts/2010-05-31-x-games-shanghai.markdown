Caught a little more sun than I should have at the <a href="http://www.kiaxgamesasia.com/en/home.php">x-games</a> this afternoon. The vest-tan is coming along nicely.

Heading all the way up to Fudan University we took a route across the river near the docks, through leafy streets and outdoor mahjong arenas to the dilapidated stadium. Detours like that really bring home the size and variety of Shanghai.
