Every country has a tat-market of stuff that got overproduced 10 years ago and offloading it to tourists is more viable than landfill. Shanghai’s best is on Dontai Lu, close to Old Shanghai. Expect “havalook!”, little red books, wooden frogs that double as instruments and somehow the feeling that you’re wasting your time. You Are!
