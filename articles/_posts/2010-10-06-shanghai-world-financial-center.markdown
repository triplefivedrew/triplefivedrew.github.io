The iconic 'bottle opener' that is the Shanghai World Financial Centre looks pretty good from afar, especially good from up close (sat atop a flush plinth of grey stone) and particularly magnificent from the wrap-around windows of the Park Hyatt, occupying the building's top 14 floors.

It's a badly kept secret that for the price of an observation-deck ticket you can sip on a cocktail in the tranquillity of the Hyatt's lobby bar and soak in the view without a kid smearing an ice-cream on your experience.

Here's a couple of not-so magnificent shots from aside a well mixed whiskey sour. I definitely need to go back there at dusk (or even better - dawn) to capture the real magic.
