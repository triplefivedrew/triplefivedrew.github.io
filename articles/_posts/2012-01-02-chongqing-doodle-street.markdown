Sure. I know people who've been or lived there. "There's a reason you've never heard of it" they say. "It's basically any big Chinese city, just bigger". But they <a href="http://www.triplefiveshanghai.com/tag/guangzhou/">said the same about Guangzhou</a> and so I remained unperturbed.

I knew it would be hectic, hazy, hilly and very Chinese. I figured there'd be some <a href="http://www.triplefiveshanghai.com/chongqing-street-food-spice/">curious local delicacies</a>, one or two AAAA tourist traps and a lot of fun.

In all my wildest projections I didn't imagine there would be an entire district covered in graffiti. There is.

Well done China. It's bloody awesome. Chongqing you proved me right. It's exactly why I came to this country.
