Found it! The elusive Haibao robot, hanging around in the built case pavilions on the cool side of the river. Added to the collection of lesser spotter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haibao">Haibao</a> (What is the plural? Haibaii? Thanks Shanghaiist for the <a href="http://shanghaiist.com/2008/09/09/call_the_police_i_am_being_attacked.php">answer</a>) around the city.
