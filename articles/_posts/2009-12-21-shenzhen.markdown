To get from Hong Kong you can either fly from Chek Lap Kok (HK international airport) or cross the border and fly from Shenzhen [or if time is no problem, take the day long train].

At half the price we went for option B. Ok so it's a bit more troublesome, especially at night when the main terminal building is closed, but otherwise it's a smooth process, not like 10 years ago when we had to wait 4 hours to get through customs.

The highlight has to be the sardine bus from the border to Shenzhen airport. Â£2 for a 45 minute journey pausing only for popcorn hawkers.
