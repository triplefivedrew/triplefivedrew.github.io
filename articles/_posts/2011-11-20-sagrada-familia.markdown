I celebrated my 18th birthday in Barcelona with a herd of architecture student. We wandered the rambles, hooting, munching on paella and visiting every <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD">Gaudi</a> on the map.

So relentless were we in making it down the list, those phenomenal buildings became lost in the ether.

I've spent the years since then perfecting my archi-white-noise-cancelling capabilities. By rolling my eyes, Archispeak Soundwaves are knocked loose from the environment. Even the most potent chat can be minimised to the faintest of rear-brain niggles.

Every nook is completely overrun with tourist ants, busily getting in the way of everything. A best approach is to stand at a backwards angle, always looking upwards. The action is all up there anyway.

The tour of the upper reaches tries to make you avoid it by slapping an extra tax and a complicated queuing system. Ignore them. Do it.
