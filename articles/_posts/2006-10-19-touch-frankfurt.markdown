So we returned from Frankfurt and the JWT Creative challenge 2006 Q3. Not even a weekend break destination, Frankfurt is good for being a city with a highly developed banking sector... and as far as we could see nothing else.

Stayed on the 13th floor of the Lindner Hotel [http://www.lindner.de/en/MP] where the TVs &amp; towels are tiny but the view huge with a corner room and no-less than 6 massive windows to admire the hazy sunrise.

Pork-a-plenty in Frankfurt is washed down with fortified apfel wine, not the most exciting of local fayre. Much better was an Italian 4-course at Biancalani [http://www.biancalani.de] across from the hotel, where each plate was slightly too rich but not detracting from an enjoyable German twist.

Don't bring your girlfriend. Don't even bring your boyfriend - Frankfurt won't be missed, even if the highlight was.
