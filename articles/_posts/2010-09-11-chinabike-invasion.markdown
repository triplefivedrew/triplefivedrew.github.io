Ah. Maybe that's why the Phoenix frames didn't sell so well; They're already all over the place. Every other lamppost has a Phoenix hanging off it. Seems people like to keep the old rod-brakes and wheels on them. Wonder if it is as fun as Shanghai to ride around London with almost useless components.
