Everywhere you go in this country there's a local delicacy. We're spoilt in Shanghai with the Xiaolongbao. Most of China's snacks are dubious or godawful. Take the Yunnan deep fried goat's cheese for example, or the Suzhou sesame paste sugar balls, or the beijing gravy dumplings. All tasty enough on the first bite but it's downhill all the way thereafter.

So, given that <a href="http://www.triplefiveshanghai.com/chongqing/">Chongqing</a> has some 31.5 million people, we were expecting a plethora of snack offerings. Take the city's proximity to pepper-loving Sichuan, distance from fresh air and the local desire to punish themselves, here are some of the worst, weirdest and damn spiciest snack foods in the world.
