No better way to say goodbye to London for a while than with a Great Queen street Chicken pie for four... for two!

It's as amazing as I <a href="http://www.triplefivedrew.com/taste-great-queen-street/">remember</a> it. Having written plenty about Shanghai's restaurants it's a strong reminder about how essential good service is to good food.
