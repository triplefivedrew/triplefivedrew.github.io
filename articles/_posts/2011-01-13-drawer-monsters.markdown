oneline: Our cats are a right couple of plonkers. Not content with all the things we've bought them to lay on - they'd rather be amongst our socks and undies.

Have finally worked out why the maid prefers to scatter our socks and undies around the bedroom floor. The answer, she doesn't. We're infested with a couple of drawer monsters.

Does anyone know a good training technique for stopping two cats from routinely prising open drawers, pulling out half their contents and then burrowing inside?
