Punctures, dings and videos about Banksy aside it was super sweet to roll around Hong Kong with the guys from <a href="http://www.hongkongfixed.com/">hongkongfixed.com/</a>, run by <a href="http://www.verymasa.com/">Masa</a>. They're an awesome bunch with some really slick rides, I glimpsed an incredibly high spec Pista, a dozen aerospokes and some highly polished chains. The guys in Guangzhou told us that dosh per km, HK outspend everybody. True that. 

We rolled past the old airport for a screening of and then paced it back at dusk to the Star Ferry through the flowing TST traffic.

Ignoring the mountain that is Central, HK is great for riding. Be warned though, there are about four bike shops in the city, three of them on the same street in Mong Kok.
