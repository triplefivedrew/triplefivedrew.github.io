In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Square_and_Park">People's Square park</a> on a weekend morning Shanghai locals gather to speak English. The group's larger than life leader grabs any passing foreigner with humorously provocative statements about European politics and English television.

Once ensnared, the english-learning chinese like to make light hearted conversations, listen to a foreign accent or try out some new sentences. I was asked "is Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, indeed in a pickle considering London's plans for a conservative olympic games following Beijing's extravaganza"
